# Minot (9 RP)

Minots are tall, stocky taurine mammals, generally possessing two horns and a maine of hair. They eat grasses, leaves, and certain fruits and fungi. For eons herds of them have migrated with the seasons, with the changing of things, and today many kinds of Minots inhabit most parts of the globe, from shaggy "Yaken" Minots that occupy unforgiving taigas to the gaunt "Elken" Minots who mind thick wild groves and the "Boken" Minots who patrol shimmering savannahs. They are strong and sturdy people, disposed to brevity and severity. Virtually any herd in stampede could destroy a town, even a city, but such events are rare if not entirely mythological as herds are known to be generally peaceful and gracious.

Each herd has an ancient history with its migration territory. Each shares this territory with innumerable other peoples, and one's coming is always known to the other. The diverse phenotypes of Minots are a testament to their enduring connection to the places that made them, that they over eons have made.

Herds have a way of knowing each other that does not involve words, but a combination of subtle gestures, expressions, and scents. This combination is like a language, and two herds far apart will find the other's language quite incomprehensible, while a non-Minot attempting to speak the language will find they cannot reproduce the essential smells with any control or subtlety. Minots generally know Common but their insular language creates an insular culture. Minots who travel without a herd are rare, and leaving the herd is generally discouraged.
