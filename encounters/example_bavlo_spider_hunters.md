# Kus-Kus, Kitch Kubi, Mugris, and the Giant Spider

The party has come upon a giant spider's web, spanning the latter part of a wide cavern. The spider's domain is pocked with natural tunnels, and the traffic has benefitted her. Travellers and animals of the deep alike are spun into her web.

Kus-Kus took 10 on Survival checks to find tracks, meeting DC 15 firm ground, and followed the spider to its lair. She rolls Stealth v Perception (19 v 14: OK) and places a Bear Trap around the corner before lining up an opening shot. Kitch Kubi remains 30ft behind, while Mugris hides in preparation to attack the spider as it rounds the corner (16). A ledge (DC 10) separates the corner from the path they arrived on.

Kus-Kus takes the shot:
- 1d20+6 = 12 v 11 => HIT
- 1d6 => 3

Spider is at 13. Initiative:

- 17: Mugris
- 16: Kus-Kus
- 08: Spider
- 05: Kitch Kubi

Mugris delays until after Kus-Kus.

Kus-Kus reloads and fires again:

- 1d20+6 => 20 => HIT
- 1d6 => 6

Mugris steps in front of Kus-Kus and readies an attack against the spider once it comes in range.

Spider is at 7. Spider crosses the 60ft cavern and climbs the 20ft to Mugris, rushing into an adjacent square. Mugris' attack goes off:

- 1d20+8 => 16
- 2d6+7 => 15

Spider is at -2, oozing death and pain. With another blow, Mugris puts it out of its misery.

But it wasn't alone: two more spiders drop from above the ledge, separating Kitch Kubi from the party.

Initiative:
- 22: Spider A (near Mugris)
- 17: Spider B (near Kitch Kubi)
- 17: Mugris
- 16: Kus-Kus
- 05: Kitch Kubi

Spider A attacks Kus-Kus, but misses. (1d20+2 => 4)

Spider B attacks Kitch Kubi, and also misses. (1d20+2 => 5)

Mugris hacks at the spider...

- 1d20+8 => 28 => CRIT
- 1d20+8 => 19 => CONFIRM
- 2d6+7 => 16 * 2 => 34

...cleaving it in two!! Its exoskeleton crunches and crumbles.

Kus-Kus waits until after Kitch Kubi.

Kitch Kubi takes a 5ft step back into a triangular natural-hewn stone intersection that they entered from, a (15^2)/2ft space, then they throw a bomb at the spider:

- 1d20+5 => 16 => HIT
- 1d6+4 => 5

Spider is at 8.

Kus-Kus reloads and fires at the spider:

- 1d20+6 => 25 => CRIT
- 1d20+6 => 24 => CONFIRM
- 1d6 => 2 * 2 => 4

Spider is at 4. Round ends, spider goes: it roars and charges at Kus-Kus, passing within range of Mugris:

- 1d20+8 => 23 => HIT
- 2d6+7 => 13

The spiders are slain. After taking a moment waiting for more to descend, Kus-Kus disables the bear trap they had laid out. The group sets about to looting the web -- carefully separating bodies and loot from the silk, which is wound with special tools and placed into treated glass bottles. Kitch Kubi plans to use it. Meanwhile Kus-Kus drags the spider corpses to the party and begins to field dress them for transport, trade, and consumption.
