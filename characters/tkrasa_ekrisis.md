# T'krasa Etrisis

Captain of the Protector Syndicate, T'krasa is a sharp and dutiful warrior. The Clan of the Tadpole has many powerful guardians, and he considers himself among them. When he had just been initiated into the Protectors, just after his Second-Shedding ritual, a whelp not three quarters his age demeaned him and his station. Words long since forgotten compelled T'krasa to fight the whelp, to demonstrate his prowess, but the little one was quick and agile... and bewitched. [Dhutlo](./dhutlo_varanidae.md) stamped the earth and it moved beneath T'krasa, throwing him on his back. His opponent had teeth around his neck before he understood what had happened. Among his clan's clicking guffaws and hissing laughter, T'krasa felt shame.

But among a clan, shame does not triumph over kinship. A rivalry developed, and each made a habit of challenging the other. They taunted each other, hissing with wide open mouths until they would descend into a brawl. Dhutlo did not always win, but enough that T'krasa felt obliged to train harder, to develop his skills further, to prove something wordless to himself as much as to them.

A chance came to prove it when a [Grux'nis](https://gist.github.com/garbados/b0b21f615241786280c1767b04e8407f) attacked the spawning pools where the egg clutches mature. What drove this great beast to attack may never be known, but it caught Dhutlo and T'krasa on protector duty. Dhutlo managed to rake its eyes before it threw them with terrible gashes into the water, so it could not see T'krasa as he read the creature. It followed the taunting sounds he made and grew agitated until it charged -- impaling itself on T'krasa's spear, coming to struggle meaninglessly upon the crossbar. He hurried Dhutlo to B'xnamsa to heal their wounds, and became the first person they saw as they opened their eyes.

"Thank you, sibling," they said.

"Sibling," T'krasa repeated, clasping their hand.
