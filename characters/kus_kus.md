# Kus-Kus

Kobold Monster Hunter. Lives in Bavlo because it's quiet, "but not too quiet." Every Monday morning, well before dawn, Kus-Kus checks the caravan guild office for bounties in the underdark concerning great beasts and bandits who attack traders moving between cities. After they take the bounty home to their room in the Lion's Share, they spend the week making traps for the next bounty.

		- Reduce cost by 50% if cannot be reset; increase by 50% if auto-reset.
		- Make a Craft check representing 1 week of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If this adds up to the cost x10, the item is finished. If it exceeds the cost by some multiple, the work is completed faster (ex: 2x -> 1/2 time).
