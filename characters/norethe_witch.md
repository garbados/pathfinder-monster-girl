		- May know any number of [witch spells](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-list-witch); must prepare spells each day.
		- Prepared 0-level spells do not consume a spell slot when used.

				- [Summon Minor Monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-minor-monster): Summon 1d3 Tiny or smaller animals, such as bats or ravens.

A creature that saves against the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind-affecting charm effect, but the hex on the target is not.
