Orcs are still staggered at 0 hit points or lower and lose 1 hit point each round as normal.
	- Weapon Familiarity: Orcs are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the word “orc” in its name as a martial weapon.
	- Darkvision: Orcs can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.
	- Light Sensitivity: Orcs are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.
