# Xe

It is troublesome how much xe talks. Xe tells stories and forgets sometimes where truth ends and belief begins, finding xirself in more trouble than xe can handle. Xe is not conning, maybe cunning, and even at worst only playing.

Xe tells stories because xe wants stories, travels far and wide for stories. Listens with elders, mothers, spirits, trees, rivers. Long is the span of knowledge, and within it is great and mysterious power. Xe wonders about power.
