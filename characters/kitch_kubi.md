He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check. The alchemist can mix a number of "extracts" that take effect when the Alchemist drinks them. See [Alchemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Alchemy-Su-) for more information, and the [Formulae List](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/formulae-lists-alchemist) for possible effects.

	- [Mutagen](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Mutagen-Su-): It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time—if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting +4 {STR,DEX,CON} and -2 {INT,WIS,CHA} respectively, and +2 natural armor bonus to AC for 10 minutes per level.
