- [Druid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/) ([Swarm Monger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/archetypes/paizo-druid-archetypes/swarm-monger/)):
	- Fecund Familiar:
		- As [Arcane Bond](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-), using Druid levels in place of Wizard levels. See [Familiars](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar/) for more info.

			- Special:
				- Grants [Alertness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness) to Norethe.
				- [Improved Evasion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/improved-evasion-ex/): Take half damage even on failed Reflex saves, take no damage on successful ones. Does not apply when helpless.

		- As a standard action, can transform familiar into swarms as four contiguous 5ft squares. While transformed, familiar loses improved evasion and cannot share spells or deliver touch attacks, but gains the [swarm subtype](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#Swarm_Subtype). Thus it can occupy any occupied space, must do so to attack, and apply damage automatically. Moving into another creature's space provokes an AOO. Swarm attacks deal 1d6 damage plus another 1d6 per 5 HD after the first, and are not hindered by concealment or cover.
		- May transform familiar n (WIS) times per day, and each transformation lasts 2 minutes (1 per level) unless ended prematurely as a standard action.

	- Low Friends: Any spells or abilities that only target animals may also target [vermin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin). You may use Wild Empathy to influence vermin as you would influence an animal.
