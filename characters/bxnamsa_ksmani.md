Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.

	- [Bruising Intellect](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/social-traits/bruising-intellect/): Intimidate is always a class skill for you, and you may use your Intelligence modifier when making Intimidate checks instead of your Charisma modifier.
