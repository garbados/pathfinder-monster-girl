# Kus-Kus

Kobold Monster Hunter. Lives in Bavlo because it's quiet, "but not too quiet." Every Monday morning, well before dawn, Kus-Kus checks the caravan guild office for bounties in the underdark concerning great beasts and bandits who attack traders moving between cities. After they take the bounty home to their room in the Lion's Share, they spend the week making traps for the next bounty.

	- Basic steps:
		- Cost: 1/3 list price, (1000gp x CR)/3, or GM discretion
		- Reduce cost by 50% if cannot be reset; increase by 50% if auto-reset.
		- Make a Craft check representing 1 week of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If this adds up to the cost x10, the item is finished. If it exceeds the cost by some multiple, the work is completed faster (ex: 2x -> 1/2 time).

- [Slayer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/Slayer/) ([Sniper](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/slayer/archetypes/paizo-slayer-archetypes/sniper)):
	- Accuracy: Halve all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow, crossbow, or firearm.
	- Studied Target 1: A slayer can study an opponent he can see as a move action. The slayer then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that opponent increase by 1. A slayer can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the slayer studies a new target.

	- \[Prospective: level 2\] Deadly Range: When the sniper makes an attack against a target who is within his weapon’s first range increment and completely unaware of his presence, that attack ignores the 30 foot range limit on ranged sneak attacks, and if it is a sneak attack, he adds his sniper level as a bonus on his sneak attack damage roll. After this first attack, the target is aware of the sniper’s presence.
- Feats:
	- Kobold Sniper: When you are sniping, you only take a –10 penalty on your Stealth checks to stay hidden.
	- \[Prospective: Stealth 3 ranks\] [Expert Sniper](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/expert-sniper-combat/): Reduce the penalty to stay hidden after sniping by 10. (Cumulative with Kobold Sniper, eliminates the penalty.)
