- [Paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin/):
	- [Aura of Good](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/PALADin/#TOC-Aura-of-Good-Ex-): Emanates an aura of Good with power equal to the Paladin's level. See [Detect Good](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good) for details on the power of auras.
	- [Detect Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/PALADin/#TOC-Detect-Evil-Sp-): At will, a paladin can use [detect evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil), as the spell. A paladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual within range.
	- [Smite Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/PALADin/#TOC-Smite-Evil-Su-): As a swift action, designate a target to smite. This grants a bonus to attacks and damage against the target if it is evil, and grants a deflection bonus to AC against the target's attacks. Smite lasts until the target is dead or the paladin rests.
