Volunteering for the rare duty of the herd's traveling healer, Ibba left home a curt but joyous woman. Her travels have shown her poverty and misery, and she has a habit of barrelling her way into disposing of little tyrants. But these conflicts only affirm her mission as a healer, not only of the body's integrity but the community's too, for it becomes an indespensible part of the land itself. Jealousy and greed are like a poison that flows downstream, which must be stemmed at the first sight.
